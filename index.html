    <h1>The Pup Café</h1>
    <p>Coffee. Community. Care.</p>
    <p class="tagline">A worker-first, dog-centered café where rescue meets dignity.</p>

  <!-- The Problem -->
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Every day, incredible rescue dogs sit in shelters — unseen, under-socialized, and often forgotten. Meanwhile, service workers in cafés and small shops are paid barely enough to survive, with no path to ownership or shared success.</p>
    <p>Traditional businesses hoard value at the top. Dogs become decoration. Workers become replaceable. And cafés become just another transaction space.</p>
    <p><strong>We believe business should feel like care — not extraction.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- The Solution -->
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>The Pup Café is a modern, mission-first café that puts dogs and workers at the center. Rescue dogs live and thrive in a certified safe café space, socializing and resting based on their needs — not performance.</p>
    <p>Workers receive livable wages and a share in profits. Customers enjoy great coffee while contributing to a system rooted in mutual aid and joy.</p>
    <p><strong>It’s more than a café — it’s an ethical ecosystem.</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- Shared Value Model -->
  <section class="slide">
    <h2>The Model: Shared Value</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dogs are treated as co-beneficiaries — not props.</li>
      <li>Workers earn more than wages — they earn value.</li>
      <li>Profits are shared between dogs, humans, and future good.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every cup of coffee supports someone who deserves more.</p>

  <!-- Ethical Profit Breakdown -->
