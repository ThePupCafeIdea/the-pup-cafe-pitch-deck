  </section>

  <!-- Slide 2: The Problem -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">The Problem</div>
    <h3>People are isolated. Dogs are abandoned. Caf√© workers are underpaid.</h3>
    <p>We live in a system that undervalues care ‚Äî for animals, for workers, and for each other.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 3: The Solution -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">The Pup Caf√© Solution</div>
    <p>A joyful, worker-powered caf√© built around rescue dogs, ethical wages, and radical community care.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 4: Mission & Model -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">Our Mission & Model</div>
    <p><span class="highlight">50%</span> of profits go to dog rescue.<br>
       <span class="highlight">30%</span> go to workers beyond wages.<br>
       <span class="highlight">10-15%</span> to community good.<br>
       <span class="highlight">1%</span> to sustain the founder.</p>
    <p>This isn‚Äôt a side note. It‚Äôs the point.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 5: A Day in the Life -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">What It Looks Like</div>
    <p>A rescued senior dog snoozes under a table. A barista smiles, paid fairly, naming drinks after shelter pups. Someone drops a donation in the jar. The coffee is good. The air smells like fresh-baked kindness.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 6: Revenue Model -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">How We Make Revenue</div>
    <p>Coffee & Food. Events. Merch. Passive Donations.</p>
    <p>Everything modeled, priced, and backed by real caf√© comps.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 7: Financial Forecast Snapshot -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">Financial Forecast</div>
    <p>We‚Äôve modeled 4 paths: average, underperforming, overperforming, and grant-supported.</p>
    <p>Realistic. Flexible. Transparent. Updated monthly.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 8: Capital Ask -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">Capital Ask</div>
    <p>We don‚Äôt need millions. We need trust and a head start.</p>
    <p>Our funding levels range from $42k (baseline) to $147k (fully flourishing).<br>
    Every dollar is accounted for and attached to mission impact.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 9: Impact Forecast -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">Projected Impact</div>
    <p><span class="highlight">Dogs saved.</span> Workers paid well. Community events hosted with joy.</p>
    <p>Every cup served supports an entire value system.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 10: Path Forward -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">Where This Goes</div>
    <p>From caf√© to co-op.<br>
       From local hub to replicable, worker-owned model.<br>
       From concept to movement.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Slide 11: The Team -->
  <section>
    <div class="slide-title">Meet the Humans</div>
    <p>I‚Äôm [Your Name]. I‚Äôm not trying to get rich.<br>
    I‚Äôm trying to build a place where dogs and people both get what they deserve.</p>
    <p>We‚Äôll grow this team with care, not capital.</p>
  </section>
