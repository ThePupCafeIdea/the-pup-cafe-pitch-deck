      <h3>Nonprofit-Aligned Services</h3>
      <ul class="evaluation-panel">
        <li><strong>Rescue & Rehoming:</strong> $800–$1,500 per non-working dog (food, vet, foster/adoption coordination)</li>
        <li><strong>Free/Low-Cost Training:</strong> Offered to veterans, diabetics, PTSD survivors (grant-supported)</li>
        <li><strong>Education Outreach:</strong> Dog enrichment classes, therapy visits, mental health seminars</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mission Statement Reminder</h3>
      <p>We are committed to reinvesting profits from our café operations to subsidize dog training and adoption for people in need. Not every pup needs a job to be part of the mission.</p>
